# Artificial Intelligence - Computer vision OpenCV applications

Image recognition application, powered by OpenCV and a custom identifier, trained using a Haar Cascade Algorithm, and greyscale images containing a target image.

This repository contains two python scripts, which both can successfully identify a mock company logo created for this application through still images used as an argument, as well as in real time through a laptop or external webcam.
